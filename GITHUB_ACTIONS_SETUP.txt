GITHUB ACTIONS APK BUILD SETUP
===============================

This guide sets up automatic APK building using GitHub Actions (free).


STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository
================================

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository:
   - Name: KANI (or any name)
   - Description: DocuVoice Android App
   - Public or Private (your choice)
   - DO NOT add README, .gitignore, or license yet
3. Click "Create repository"


STEP 2: Push Your Code to GitHub
================================

Open PowerShell in your project root:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Varunesh\Desktop\New folder\KANI'

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: DocuVoice Android app"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO)
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

The `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` file will automatically be recognized.


STEP 3: Trigger Build
=====================

**Option A: Automatic (Easiest)**
- Just push code to `android_app/` folder
- Workflow automatically triggers
- Wait ~30 minutes for build

**Option B: Manual Trigger**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "Build APK" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
5. Wait for build to complete


STEP 4: Download APK
====================

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click the completed workflow run
4. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
5. Click "docuvoice-apk" to download
6. Extract ZIP file
7. APK is ready to install!


STEP 5: Create Release (Optional)
=================================

To create a tagged release with automatic APK upload:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Varunesh\Desktop\New folder\KANI'

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

APK will automatically upload to GitHub Releases page.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Build takes too long?
  → First build can take 30-40 minutes
  → Subsequent builds are faster (~10-15 min)

Build fails?
  → Check workflow logs in Actions tab
  → Look for error message
  → Common issues:
    - Insufficient disk space (GitHub has 14GB)
    - Missing dependencies
    - Buildozer configuration issues

APK not downloading?
  → Check if build succeeded (green checkmark)
  → Look in Artifacts section
  → Wait a few seconds after build completes


ADVANTAGES
==========

✓ No local setup required
✓ Completely free (GitHub Actions free tier)
✓ Runs in cloud (fast CPU)
✓ Automatic on code push
✓ No Docker needed
✓ No complex configuration
✓ Artifacts kept 30 days
✓ Releases available forever


TIPS
====

1. Keep .github/workflows/build-apk.yml in sync with this file

2. Modify trigger events in build-apk.yml:
   - `push:` - build on every push
   - `workflow_dispatch:` - manual trigger
   - Schedule builds: add `schedule:`

3. To speed up builds:
   - Only modify android_app/ folder
   - Don't modify workflow file frequently

4. For production releases:
   - Use git tags for version control
   - Let GitHub Actions create releases
   - Download APK from Releases page


NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Create GitHub account if you don't have one:
   https://github.com/signup

2. Create new repository:
   https://github.com/new

3. Push code following Step 2 above

4. Workflow will start automatically

5. Download APK from Actions artifacts in 30 minutes
